# Banshee
This repository has been created for hosting the project of the 2021/2022 course of Laboratory, held by prof. Francesca Tomasi at Univeristy of Bologna under the Master's Degree program of Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge. 

The project focuses on exploiting some of the techniques showed in class (Digital History, Blender modeling, Sotrytelling) to explore the topic of ancient Irish Mythology, specifically, the Myth of the Banshee.
