                <h1>The origin of the Banshee myth</h1>
                <p> <b>Etymology: </b>The word Banshee derives from the Irish language known as Gaelic. She is also called Banshie, Bean Si, Bean Sidhe, and Ban Side, among other name variations. Banshee is comprised of two words in Irish, ‘bean’ and ‘sídhe’ which literally means ‘female fairy’ or ‘woman of the otherworld’. The bean sdhe—spelled ban sith in Scots Gaelic but sounds the same—is one of numerous fairies in Gaelic folklore who use the "[word] + sdhe/sith" name convention. There is also a lovely enchantress known as the leannán sdhe, a big black cat known as the cat-sth, and a green dog known as the cù-sth.  </p>
                <p> <b>Source:</b>  <a href="https://books.google.it/books?id=wmPXAAAAMAAJ">A Dictionary of Irish Mythology. Ellis, P.B. 1987</a></p>
                <p><b>Shape and habits of a Banshee:</b>The Banshee fairy is a female spirit who lives by the river. They can have the appearance of an old hag or a young and beautiful woman. The Banshee was seen as the omen of death and only cried for certain ancient Irish families, (with names such as O’Neil, O’Connor, and O’Donnell) often staying near the home a particular lineage for generations. In Ireland and Scotland, it was once traditional for women to wail or keen at funerals or Irish wakes, which was inspired by the keen of the Banshee. Hearing her cry signalled that death was nearby. Having foresight, she would appear before the death occurred, weeping the loss in the family. It was believed that the banshee fairy sang such a sad song because she was a friend of the family, she was not anything evil, she was simply mourning an unavoidable and tragic death. According to folklore, a Banshee ghost would sometimes perch on a windowsill in the form of a bird, where she’d remain for several hours or even days until death comes to call. Often, as the Banshee escapes into the darkness, witnesses have described a bird-like fluttering sound. Thus, some believe that banshees are birdlike creatures. The Banshee spirit also wails in other areas such as woods, rivers, and rock formations. In Waterford, Monaghan, and Carlow, there are wedge-shaped rocks which are referred to as “Banshee’s Chairs.”</p>
                <p>In some cases, the Banshee fairy was reported to look like a simple washerwoman or laundress. The clothes she tended to wash were blood-stained and the armour she washed belonged to a soldier who would die in their next battle. As mentioned, Banshee can manifest in many forms and disguises, the most common of which is the appearance of a beautiful or ugly woman. But they are also believed to appear as animals like the weasel, stoat, hare, or the hooded crow. These animals were commonly associated with witchcraft in Ireland in the past which probably explains the connection. The Banshee is usually perceived as being quite fair, with long, pale hair that she grooms with a special silver comb. According to superstition, finding a comb on the ground and picking it up is extremely bad luck, because a Banshee has placed it there to lure the unsuspecting and lead them to ruin.</p>
                <p>Subsequent Christian tradition, which, in Ireland, has been strictly tied with old Gaelic folklore, seem to juxtappose the Banshee with a witch, or even a haunting presence that scares and prepare men for their death. More recent traditions state that the Banshee is the soul of a young woman, which, having being mistreated by a man during her lifetime, wonders aorund the countryside, warning him of his incoming death. The Romantic scholars, such as Yates, mainly contributed to the forging of this view, which is still noticeable in modern readaptations of the myth. In its most modern acception, influenced by pop culture and cinema, the Banshee survives in its most horror-like features.  </p>
